***Color Scheme***
This is a small quick app on selecting colors via search bar to all available colors that was inside the json file.
Design is made from bootstrap with some minor custom set up.
Mainly done with JS-jquery scripts and jquery UI for the autocomplete of color searching.
Another feature is you are able to view the colors you selected and delete the selected colors in the color scheme.
Features:
1. Auto complete search of desired color.
2. Displaying of selected color with its sample color value to show and compare to other colors.
3. Action delete for removing of the selected color.

I chose this approach to make it more diverse in terms of selecting colors of the desired value and to have a visual example on what they chose. 
Design is very basic and simple to make it more clean and not too flashy. 
The JSON file for the colors have a lot of variety and if you still want to add more you can just edit it or redirect the URL of the JS file to have a more controlled color selection
to a different source if you want to.
